    <p>American Pitbull Terrier's are very active creatures that use a bunch of energy.</p>
    <p>Most Apbt's like to do lots of running and investigating.</p>
    <p>Apbt's require different activities including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Running</li>
        <li>Jumping</li>
        <li>Teaching</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are some of the minimal expectations required for such energetic and observant animals.</p>
    <p>According to the ADBA, the American Pit Bull is described to be medium-sized and has a short coat 
       and smooth well-defined muscle structure, and its eyes are to be round to almond-shaped, and its ears 
       are to be small to medium in length, typically half prick or rose in carriage. </p>
